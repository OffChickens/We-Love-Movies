# We-Love-Movies

This is my solution to Thinkful's WeLoveMovies backend development project.

### Technologies used
- JavaScript
- Express: Framework used for handling routing, middleware and creating a RESTful API
- Knex: SQL query builder used for my SQL database
- SQL: Used to manage and query the relational database

This project was a test of my ability to build complex servers and access data through a database.

I was tasked with the following:

- Install and use common middleware packages.
- Receive requests through routes.
- Running tests from the command line.
- Access relevant information through route and query parameters.
- Create an error handler for the case where a route does not exist.
- Build an API following RESTful design principles.
- Create and customize a knexfile.js file.
- Create a connection to your database with Knex.
- Write database queries to complete CRUD routes in an Express server.
- Return joined and nested data with Knex.
- Write database migrations using Knex's migration tools.
- Deploy your backend server to a cloud service.

It was a very enjoyable project that ignited my passion for backend development specifically. Creating multiple database tables and routes to fit all of the puzzle pieces together perfectly.
